# ðŸš€ NEURO PILOT
AI-powered machine learning workflow automation for everyone

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
*Problem Statement 11:*  
The AutoML Pipeline Generator is a CLI-based tool designed to automate and optimize machine learning workflows by leveraging AI agents for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. Built on GroqCloud for high-speed processing, it intelligently analyzes datasets, recommends optimal models, and generates deployment-ready pipelinesâ€”reducing manual effort while improving accuracy for both beginners and experts in ML.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
NEURO PILOT transforms complex machine learning workflows into intuitive automated processes. By leveraging AI-powered assistance through Groq's high-performance LLMs, our platform democratizes machine learning for data scientists of all skill levels. Users can seamlessly search for datasets, perform intelligent preprocessing, visualize data insights, and automatically train multiple models to find the optimal solutionâ€”all through a modern, user-friendly interface rather than traditional CLI commands.

## ðŸ§  Team & Approach
*Team Name:*  
Bit-Storm Syndicate

*Team Members:*
* Achyut Vyas ([GitHub](https://github.com/snowxx456) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/achyut-vyas-874184258/)) â€“ ML Engineer & Backend Developer
* Aryan Khandelwal ([GitHub](https://github.com/flashark271) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan10khandelwal/)) â€“ Frontend Developer & UX Designer
* Harsh Jain ([GitHub](https://github.com/Harsh1260) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-jain-b071b424a/)) â€“ Data Scientist & ML Pipeline Architect
* Vaibhav Tayal ([GitHub](https://github.com/vaibhavtayal6) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavtayal/)) â€“ Full Stack Developer & SystemÂ Integration


*Our Approach:*
* We identified a significant gap between the powerful capabilities of AutoML and their accessibility. While CLI tools offer flexibility, they often present steep learning curves for newcomers and tedious workflows for experts.
* Our key challenge was transforming a traditionally CLI-based workflow into an intuitive GUI without compromising power or customization. We addressed this by leveraging Groq's LLMs to power intelligent suggestions and automate the entire ML pipeline.
* A major breakthrough occurred when we integrated Groq's API with PandasAI to create a natural language interface for data preprocessingâ€”enabling users to transform their data via conversational prompts rather than complex coding.
