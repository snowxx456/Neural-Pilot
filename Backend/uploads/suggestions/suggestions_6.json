Okay, so I need to help the user by providing detailed cleaning recommendations for their dataset based on the information they've given. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, I'll look at the dataset summary and the issues they've identified. The dataset has several columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. Each of these has specific types and associated issues.

Starting with the Date column. It's classified as datetime, but it's stored as an object type, which is a problem because datetime operations won't work correctly on it. The values look like they're in YYYY-MM-DD format, which is good, but I need to make sure it's converted to a proper datetime format. Also, there's a warning about high cardinality, but since it's a date, having many unique dates is normal, so maybe that's not a big issue.

Next, the numeric columns: Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. All of these are numeric but stored as float64 or int64. They have issues with skewness, meaning their distributions aren't normal. For example, Volume has a high skew of 4.58, which indicates a lot of outliers on the higher end. These columns also have a note about stripping non-numeric characters, even though they're already numeric. Maybe the data was read correctly, but it's good to check for any hidden characters.

The issues section highlights that Date is stored as an object, which is critical. All numeric columns have skewed distributions, and Volume is especially problematic. High cardinality in Date isn't as concerning because each date is unique.

Now, for each column, I need to outline the confirmed type, any anomalies, cleaning operations, and an example fix.

For Date:
- Confirmed type is datetime.
- Anomalies include being stored as an object and high cardinality.
- Operations should involve converting the column to datetime and maybe handling timezone if needed, though the data doesn't show any timezone info.
- Example fix would be using pandas to convert, like pd.to_datetime.

For each numeric column (Open, High, etc.):
- Confirmed type is numeric.
- Anomalies are the skewed distribution and possible non-numeric chars.
- Operations include handling outliers, maybe with IQR or log transformation, and ensuring all values are numeric.
- Example fix could involve removing any non-numeric characters and applying a log transformation to reduce skew.

Volume has similar issues but with a higher skew. Same steps apply: clean the data and handle the skew.

Global issues to note are the incorrect storage of datetime and the overall skew in numeric columns. The priority should be fixing the Date column first since it's critical, followed by addressing the numeric columns.

I should structure the response as per the required JSON format, making sure each column has its own entry with specific details. Also, list the global issues and the priority order for cleaning.
